# Tauri OnLoad Example

This is a kind of still-life exercise in disabling some frontend behaviors until a slow backend process has completed.
It could be loading a JSON file from disk, or many HTTP calls, or a database migration.

## Dependencies

This should be a plain vanilla Tauri app, but see https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/ for installing Rust, tauri, and other tooling for your platform.

## How to run

once you've downloaded the code, you can run:

```shell

cargo tauri dev
```
